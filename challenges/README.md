# Reverse an Array
Paired with Trey Herndon for seattle-java-401d3 Code Challenge 01.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray that takes in an array as an argument and returns an array with the elements in reverse order. 

## Approach and Efficiency
We used a for loop to iterate over the array until the midpoint of the array length, swaping elements until the array is sorted. 

## Solution
